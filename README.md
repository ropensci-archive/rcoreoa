CORE API R client

CORE API docs: https://core.ac.uk/docs/

rcoreoa docs: https://docs.ropensci.org/rcoreoa/

Get an API key at https://core.ac.uk/api-keys/register. You'll need one, 
so do this now if you haven't yet. Once you have the key, you can pass it 
into the `key` parameter, or as a much better option store your key as an 
environment variable with the name `CORE_KEY` or an R option as `core_key`. 
See `?Startup` for how to work with env vars and R options
