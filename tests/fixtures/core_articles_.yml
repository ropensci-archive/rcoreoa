        This paper discusses the potential contribution of an eco-theology to the
        management of marine resources. The claim of the Christian gospel is that
        God has a plan for everything in the universe and we are to live to bring
        it about. The Hebrew\/Christian world view is significantly different from
        naturalism and humanism, the prevailing Greek world views in natural resource
        management. Three biblical paradigms are examined with insights into key elements
        in the management of fisheries: dominion; regulation and valuation and caring.
        In dominion we see the strength of mankind\u0026apos;s rule over other species,
        including fish, misused. Fisheries management generally fails to reign in
        this driving force, rewarding greed while calling for restraint. Regulation
        and its impact on mindsets and behaviour, is a theme evident in the Old and
        New Testaments- entering the promised land, keeping the law and caring for
        others, both humans and fish. The biblical view also emphasises life, death
        and resurrection as the process seen in nature. New fishery management paradigms
        may only develop after old ways and attitudes have died. Significant attitudinal
        change is essential to improve fisheries management and to achieve new management
        arrangements. Improved fishery stewardship may require \u0026quot;a new fisher\u0026quot;,
        relationally mature and societally accountable, to achieve the goals of sustainable
        fishery management through a variety of policy paradigms. The Christian world
        view promotes such attitudinal change to improve stewardship through reconciling
        issues in our relationship with God, neighbours and nature. It is worthy of
        further investigation","identifiers":["oai:CiteSeerX.psu:10.1.1.152.9831",null],"relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"145","openDoarId":0,"name":"CiteSeerX","uri":null,"urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":0,"metadataAdded":1413992534000,"metadataUpdated":1529412166000,"depositedDate":1266364800000},"subjects":["text"],"topics":["Ecology","Theology","Eco-theology","Fisheries
