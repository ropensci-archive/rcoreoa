        Corpus analysis, automatic text processing techniques, argumentation \nPROBLEM
        BACKGROUND \nIncreasingly, research in CSCL addresses quantitative process
        analysis through multi-dimensional coding \nschemes (e.g., Fischer, Bruhn,
        Gr\u00e4sel, \u0026 Mandl, 2002; Lally \u0026 De Laat, 2002). The process
        of collaboration is \nseen as a mediator between the computer-supported instructional
        settings and cognitive processes. Often only \ndetailed process analyses reveal
        plausible interpretations of the effects of CSCL environments (Weinberger,
        \n2003). Conducting detailed process analyses involves applying categorical
        coding schemes along multiple \ndimensions, each of which indicate something
        different about the text segment\u2019s function within the \ncollaborative
        discourse. For example, Lally and De Laat (2002) code for activities along
        six dimensions \nincluding cognitive, meta-cognitive, affective, design, discourse
        maintenance, and direct instruction. Multi-\ndimensional coding schemes like
        these encode much more information than frameworks in which each text \nsegment
        is coded with a single category.  However, while single dimensional analyses
        can be expedited by \nrequiring participants to select contribution openers
        that are indicative of contribution function, this is not \npractical with
        multi-dimensional coding. Furthermore, applying multi-dimensional categorical
        coding schemes \nby hand is extremely time intensive for three reasons. First,
        developing the coding schemes themselves in such a \nway that human coders
        can apply them reliably is a lengthy process requiring much iteration. Second,
        \nsophisticated coding schemes may require a high skill level and intensive
        training before coders can apply a \nwell-designed coding scheme with high
        reliability. Thus, training time for learning a new coding scheme is \nanother
        source of time expense involved in this type of research. Finally, applying
        coding schemes as part of the \nanalysis process itself is a tedious and time
        consuming process. Surprisingly, although structured editors often \nsupport
        this work, other times it is done by pen and paper. We therefore conducted
        a study to find out the degree \nto which automatic classification technology
        can be successfully used to automate the challenging task of multi-\ndimensional
        quantitative process analysis.  \nIn this paper we present results of an evaluation
        study of the TagHelper technology for supporting and \nstreamlining the process
        of multi-dimensional analysis of the collaborative learning process. We begin
        by \ncontextualizing our technological explorations within a high profile
        CSCL environment. We then review related \nwork and explain how our work is
        unique and complementary to previous automatic analysis work within the \nCSCL
        community. We then describe our exploration process and the details of our
        evaluation. We conclude \nwith discussion and current directions. MOTIVATION
        \nThe main question addressed in this paper is the extent to which automatic
        classification technology can be used \nto automate the task of multi-dimensional
        quantitative process analysis. Addressing this question, we first \npresent
        a promising approach to this challenging task - TagHelper technology. Then
        we report on major results \nof an evaluation study of TagHelper in the context
        of a high profile CSCL project. In this project, a multi-\ndimensional coding
        scheme is applied to massive amounts of discourse data in order to examine
        the process of \ncollaboration under different instructional conditions.  \nWithin
        the context of this project, a series of experimental studies were conducted
        that aimed to address the \nquestion of how computer-supported collaboration
        scripts could foster argumentative knowledge construction in \nonline discussions.
        Argumentative knowledge construction is based on the perspective of cognitive
        elaboration, \nthe idea that learners acquire knowledge through argumentation
        with one or more learning partners (Baker, \n2003; Dillenbourg, 2004). Computer-supported
        collaboration scripts apply on specific dimensions of \nargumentative knowledge
        construction, e.g., a script for argument construction could support learners
        to ground \nand warrant their claims (Kollar, Fischer, \u0026 Hesse, 2003;
        Stegmann, Weinberger, Fischer, \u0026 Mandl, 2004) or a \nsocial collaboration
        script can support conflict orientation (Weinberger, 2003). These and other
        computer-\nsupported collaboration scripts were varied experimentally (see
        Stegmann et al., 2004; Weinberger, 2003; \nWeinberger, Fischer, \u0026 Mandl,
        submitted for more detailed process analyses).  These studies were conducted
        in \nthree waves. The first wave took place in the winter of 2000\/2001, the
        second in the winter of 2002\/2003, and \nthe third in the winter of 2003\/2004.
        The complete process analysis comprises about 200 discussions of about \n600
        participants with altogether more than 17,000 coded text segments. Trained
        coders categorized each \nsegment using a multi-dimensional coding scheme
        (see below). \nThree groups of about six coders, one group for each wave,
        were trained to apply the coding scheme to the \ncollected corpus. One and
        the same trainer advised the analysts during all of the three waves. Each
        coder \nreceived a booklet with a detailed description of the coding scheme
        including all coding rules and examples for \neach category to ensure coding
        reliability. The training consisted of a combination of group meetings, dyadic
        \npractice, and individual practice. At regular intervals the reliability
        of the coding was computed by means of \nCohen\u2019s Kappa.  Discrepancies
        were then discussed and resolved. Between the training and the coding itself,
        \none quarter of the total duration of the research project was used for the
        coding of collaborative processes. In \nparticular, the training for each
        group of coders requires about several weeks, or about 500 working hours \ncompletely
        dedicated to the training process. The coding itself took about one month
        per wave, or about 1200 \nworking hours.  \nObviously a fully-automatic or
        even semi-automatic system, which could support coding of natural language
        \ncorpus data, e.g., from computer-supported text-based communication, would
        facilitate and potentially improve \nquantitative process analyses in multiple
        ways. First of all, the number of working hours could be dramatically \nreduced
        for both training and coding. The role of the analysts could be reduced to
        simply checking the automatic \ncoding and making corrections if necessary.
        Thus, the level of expertise of the coders could potentially be \nreduced,
        which would further reduce the cost. The coding itself would be faster.  As
        learning processes could be \nanalyzed promptly, even on the fly, facilitators
        could quickly identify specific deficits of collaborative learners \nas they
        are interacting and offer specific instructional support at key points. \nOVERVIEW
        OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY \nRichards (1999), Soller \u0026 Lesgold (2000) and
        Goodman et al. (to appear) present work on automatically \nmodeling the process
        of collaborative learning by detecting sequences of speech acts that indicate
        either success \nor failure in the collaborative process. The automatic analysis
        presented in this previous CSCL work builds upon \nan already completed categorical
        analysis of the text. These analyses can be thought of as meta-analyses with
        \nrespect to the type of analysis we speak of. In contrast, the analysis that
        we present in this paper is based on the \nraw text contributed by the participants
        in the collaborative learning scenarios. What is different about our \napproach
        is that we start with the raw text and detect features within the text itself
        that are diagnostic of different \nlocal aspects of the collaboration. Thus,
        rather than presenting a competing approach, we present an approach \nthat
        is complementary to that presented in prior work. \nCurrently there is a wide
        range of corpus analysis tools used to support corpus analysis work either
        at a very \nlow level (e.g., word frequency statistics, collocational analyses,
        etc.) or at a high level (e.g., exploratory \nsequential data analysis once
        a corpus has been coded with a categorical coding scheme), but no tools to
        support \nthe time consuming task of doing the categorical behavioral coding
        or content analysis, although much \napplicable technology developed in the
        language technologies community is already in existence. Content \nanalysis
        includes both categorical analyses as well as more detailed, bottom-up analyses
        where spontaneous, \ninformal observations about verbal behavior are recorded.
        In this paper we address the problem of streamlining \nthe categorical type
        of protocol analysis.   \nFigure 1. Abbreviated overview of some existing
        corpus analysis tools and technology \n \nCurrently, the only existing tools
        to support categorical content analysis are structured editors similar to
        Nb \n(Flammia \u0026 Zue, 1995) and MATE (McKelvie et al., 2000) or a wide
        variety of XML editors. We are exploring \nthe application of state-of-the-art
        dialogue act tagging and text classification technology to enable fully and
        \nsemi-automatic coding.  \nApplying Language Technology to a Previously Unexplored
        Application \nApplying a categorical coding scheme can be thought of as a
        text classification problem where a computer \ndecides which code to assign
        to a text based on a model that it has built based on regularities found from
        \nexamining \u201ctraining examples\u201d that were coded by hand and provided
        to it. A number of such statistical \nclassification and machine learning
        techniques have been applied to text categorization, including regression
        \nmodels (Yang \u0026 Pedersen, 1997), nearest neighbor classifiers (Yang
        \u0026 Pedersen, 1997), decision trees (Lewis \n\u0026 Ringuette), Bayesian
        classifiers (Dumais et al., 1998), Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998),
        rule \nlearning algorithms (Cohen \u0026 Singer, 1996), relevance feedback
        (Rocchio, 1971), voted classification (Weiss et \nal., 1999), and neural networks
        (Wiener et al., 1993).  While these approaches are different in many technical
        \nrespects that are beyond the scope of this paper to describe, they are all
        used in the same way. A wide range of \nsuch machine learning algorithms are
        available in the Minorthird text-learning toolkit (Cohen et al, 2004), which
        \nwe use as a resource for the work reported here. Minorthird is a software
        package that includes a wide range of \nconfigurable machine learning algorithms
        that can be used for text classification experimentation. \nWithin the computational
        linguistics community, a very common type of categorical coding scheme applied
        \nto text is that of speech acts or dialogue acts (Chu-Caroll, 1998; Reithinger
        \u0026 Klessen, 1997). Classifying \nspoken utterances into dialogue acts
        or speech acts has been a common way of characterizing utterance function
        \nsince the 1960s.  We argue that the same basic technology has the potential
        to achieve a much broader impact by \nbecoming more accessible outside the
        computational linguistics community as well as using a broader range of \ncoding
        schemes.  One example of a community where this technology could have a major
        impact is the CSCL \nresearch community where large quantities of natural
        language data are being collected and analyzed \npainstakingly by hand.  \nUnfortunately,
        existing text classification technology is largely inaccessible to CSCL researchers
        who need \nand want semi-automatic tagging support because they do not have
        the background to apply it effectively to \ntheir analysis tasks.  They are
        largely unaware of the wide range of alternative text classification techniques
        that \nare available, and furthermore, they do not possess the technical skills
        required to predict which available \napproaches are likely to be most appropriate
        for their task or to tune an appropriate technique once selected.   \nBridging
        the Gap Between Language Technology and CSCL Research \nThe goal of our current
        work is to bridge the gap found in existing corpus analysis tools used by
        CSCL \nresearchers for analyzing corpus data.  In this paper we focus on the
        highly accurate text classification \ntechnology that enables some categorical
        corpus analysis work to be done totally automatically. In other work \nwe
        have developed and tested an easy-to-use adaptive coding interface (Ros\u00e9
        et al., submitted). The easy-to-use \nTagHelper interface displays its automatic
        predictions about the analysis of each span of text to the analyst in \nthe
        form of an adaptive menu-based interface.  The system\u2019s predictions are
        visible to the analyst as he scans the \npage and modifies only the codes
        that he disagrees with by making an alternative selection. Ros\u00e9 et al.
        (submitted) have evaluated TagHelper\u2019s novel adaptive interface for facilitating
        content analysis \nof corpus data in comparison with an otherwise identical
        non-adaptive interface in terms of speed, validity, and \nreliability of coding.  Since
        deciding to disagree with a predicted code and then choosing a new code takes
        \nlonger than selecting a code from scratch, the advantage in coding speed
        for automatic predictions depends upon \nthe accuracy with which predictions
        can be made. In order to break even with speed, a prediction accuracy of at
        \nleast 50% is required. 50% prediction accuracy leads to an increase in reliability
        and validity of coding.  In an \nevaluation with novice analysts in (Ros\u00e9
        et al., submitted), the top 30% of novice coders working with the \nautomatic
        predictions achieved an average pairwise Kappa agreement measure of .71 in
        comparison with .54 in \nthe unsupported coding condition (P \u003C .05).  Novice
        agreement with a gold standard was marginally higher (P \u003C \n.1) across
        the whole population of coders. A gold standard corpus is a corpus that has
        been coded with a coding \nscheme, and the codes have been verified to be
        reliable. Thus, using automatic coding support, acceptable \nreliability and
        validity of coding can be achieved with novice coders using very little training.
        TagHelper can be \nquickly adapted for a new coding scheme and domain by providing
        only a small corpus of example texts \nencoded in XML and a simple specification
        of the structure of the coding scheme.   \nMETHOD \nIn this paper, we examine
        the feasibility of TagHelper for supporting fully automatic analyses of the
        \nprocesses of argumentative collaborative knowledge construction.  In this
        work, a human was required to \noptimize the selection and tuning of an appropriate
        machine learning algorithm.  However, once a model was \ntrained on the data
        using the selected technique, TagHelper was used to code data in a fully-automatic
        way. \nCoding scheme for argumentative knowledge construction \nIn this section
        we describe a coding scheme that was applied in a project with more than 600
        students of \nEducational Science at the Ludwig-Maximillians university of
        Munich, who participated in groups of three in \nmultiple studies. Students
        in all experimental conditions had to work together in applying theoretical
        concepts to \nthree case problems and jointly prepare an analysis for each
        case by communicating via web-based discussion \nboards. They were asked to
        discuss the three cases against the background of attribution theory (Weiner,
        1985) \nand to jointly compose at least one final analysis for each case,
        i.e. they usually drafted initial analyses, \ndiscussed them, and wrote a
        final analysis. The cases portrayed typical attribution problems of university
        \nstudents, e.g., a student interpreting his failure on an important test.
        All groups collaborated in three discussion \nboards \u2013 one for each case.
        The discussion boards provided a main page with an overview of all message
        \nheaders, which were graphically represented in a discussion thread structure.
        Learners could read the full text of \nall messages, reply to the messages,
        or compose and post new messages. In the replies, the original messages \nwere
        quoted with \u0022\u003E\u0022 as in standard newsreaders and e-mail programs.
        \nThe purpose of our analysis was to model the process of argumentative knowledge
        construction.   \nArgumentative knowledge construction must be evaluated on
        multiple process dimensions (Weinberger \u0026 \nFischer, in press). These
        dimensions are derived from different theoretical approaches and focus on
        different \nconcepts of argumentative knowledge construction. The main concepts
        are (1) epistemic activity, formal quality \nof argumentation, which includes
        (2) microlevel and (3) macrolevel, and (4) social modes of interaction (with
        a \nsub-dimension for (5) reaction). In accordance with the theoretical approach,
        the number of categories differs \nbetween dimensions from 2 (e.g., reaction)
        to 35 (e.g., epistemic). For experimental reasons, there is also a (6) \ntreatment
        check dimension and a (7) quoted dimension. \nOn the (1) epistemic dimension
        (see table 1), argumentative knowledge construction processes are to be \nanalyzed
        with respect to the questions of how learners work on the learning task, e.g.,
        what content they are \nreferring to or applying. One important distinction
        on the epistemic process dimension is to what extent learners \nwork on the
        task or digress off task (Cohen, 1994). In order to solve a problem, learners
        may need to construct a \nproblem space, construct a conceptual space, and
        construct relations between the conceptual and problem \nspaces. With the
        construction of the problem space, learners are to acquire an understanding
        of the problem they \nare supposed to work on. Therefore, learners select
        and relate individual components of the problem case \ninformation. The construction
        of the conceptual space serves to communicate an understanding of a theory.
        \nLearners connect individual theoretical concepts or distinguish them from
        another. The construction of relations \nbetween conceptual and problem space
        indicates to what extent learners are able to apply theoretical concepts \nadequately.
        In particular, learners may apply theoretical concepts that are to be learned,
        apply concepts \nstemming from prior knowledge or also apply wrong concepts.  \nOn
        the formal dimension of argumentation, the processes of argumentative knowledge
        construction can be \nexamined on both a micro- and a macrolevel of representation
        that indicate how learners construct single \narguments and how learners connect
        arguments into sequences. In contrast to the epistemic dimension, the \nformal
        dimension of argumentative knowledge construction is not as concerned with
        what learners are \ncontributing, but how they construct arguments and argumentation
        sequences in order to make their point. \n  \nTable 1: Categories of epistemic
        dimension of argumentative knowledge construction \nCategory Description \nConstruction

        concepts adequately to solve a problem. Learners \nrelate theoretical concepts
        to case information. A number of concept-case-relations \nmay need to be constructed

        each case problem of the Munich study)  \nConstruction of \ninadequate relations

        that stem from prior knowledge rather than the new theoretical \nconcepts
        that are to be learned.  \nNon-epistemic \nactivities \nDigressing off-topic.  \nOn
        the (2) microlevel, an individual argument consists of a claim, which can
        be grounded with a warrant \nand\/or specified by a qualifier (Toulmin, 1958;
        Toulmin, Rieke, \u0026 Janik, 1984). The warrant contains a \njustification
        for the claim based on grounds. The qualifier limits the validity of the statement
        and can be \nsometimes represented implicitly in the structure of an argument,
        e.g., indicated by \u201cperhaps\u201d. We regard the \nfrequent use of warrants
        and qualifiers in an argument as an indicator for high argumentative skill
        (see table 2).  \nOn the (3) macrolevel, argumentation sequences can be examined
        with respect to how learners connect \nsingle arguments and create an argumentation
        pattern together (Leit\u00e3o, 2000). The analysis typically focuses on \nthe
        rhetorical function of individual expressions in a sequence of contributions.
        Central concepts are argument, \ncounterargument and reply\/integration (see
        table 3).  \n \nTable 2: Categories of microlevel of formal dimension of argumentative

        \nAssessing the value of arguments or the group work. \n \nThe (4) social
        modes dimension (see table 4) indicates to what degree or in what ways learners
        refer to the \ncontributions of their learning partners. On this dimension,
        a number of social modes of co-construction and their relations to individual
        knowledge construction have been identified (Fischer et al., 2002). Learners
        may \nexplicate their knowledge, e.g., by contributing a new analysis of a
        problem case. Externalizations are discourse \nmoves that neither refer to
        preceding contributions of peers nor aim to elicit information from the learning
        \npartners. Learners may use the learning partner as resource and seek information
        (elicitation) in discourse from \nthe learning partners in order to solve
        a problem case. Learners need to build at least a minimum consensus \nregarding
        the learning task in a process of negotiation in order to improve collaboration
        (Clark \u0026 Brennan, \n1991). There are different styles of reaching consensus,
        however. Quick consensus building means that learners \naccept the contributions
        of their learning partners not in terms of taking over his or her perspective,
        but in order \nto be able to continue the discourse (Clark \u0026 Brennan,
        1991). Recent approaches towards collaborative learning \nstress that collaborative
        learners may eventually establish and maintain shared conceptions of a subject
        matter \n(integration-oriented consensus building). Learners approximate and
        integrate each other\u2019s perspective, \nsynthesize their ideas, and jointly
        try to make sense of a task (Nastasi \u0026 Clements, 1992). Conflict-oriented
        \nconsensus building has been considered an important component in the socio-cognitive
        perspective upon \ncollaborative learning (Doise \u0026 Mugny, 1984; Teasley,
        1997). By facing a critique, learners may be pushed to \ntest multiple perspectives
        or find more and better arguments for their positions (Chan, Burtis, \u0026
        Bereiter, 1997).  \nIn addition, any segment following an elicitation from
        another learning partner was coded on an explicit \ndichotomous (5) sub-dimension
        of reaction (no reaction vs. reaction). If a learner responded to an elicitation,
        \ne.g., by answering to a question, this response has been coded as reaction
        \n \nTable 4: Categories of social modes dimension of argumentative knowledge

        and applying the perspectives of the learning partners. \nConflict-oriented
        \nconsensus building \nDisagreeing, modifying or replacing the perspectives
        of the learning partners. \nThe  (6) treatment check dimension indicates how
        learners interact with the instructional design. The \ncomputer-supported
        collaboration script approach is often implemented with the help of prompts.
        These prompts \nsupport collaboration of learners and become part of the corpus
        data. This dimension considers how learners \nmake use of prompts. Learners
        could use the prompts in the intended manner, e.g., write a counterargument
        \nwhen they are asked to write a counterargument. But learners could also
        ignore the prompt, i.e., write nothing in \nresponse to the prompt. If learners
        are prompted to write a counterargument but wrote an argument, it would be
        \nan  unintended use of prompt. Obviously, this dimension could only be applied
        if prompts are part of the \ninstruction. Prompts within the corpus data will
        be only analyzed on this single dimension. \n \nTable 5: Categories of treatment

        use of \nprompt \nUsing prompt, but not like intended. \n \nThe dichotomous
        (7) quoted dimension is a primary technical dimension (not quoted vs. quoted).
        As already \nmentioned before, in the replies, the original messages were
        quoted with \u0022\u003E\u0022 as in standard newsreaders and e-\nmail programs.
        Quoted text within the corpus data then will be only analyzed on this single
        dimension. \nExperimental Process \nWe used the Minorthird text-learning toolkit
        (Cohen et al, 2004), which contains a large collection of \nconfigurable machine
        learning algorithms that can be applied to text classification tasks, as a
        framework in \nwhich to conduct our research. Because Minorthird includes
        a wide range of text classification algorithms that \nall operate over text
        coded in the same format, it is a convenient test environment for experimentation.
        We used \nas a gold-standard corpus as set of 1255 separate text segments
        coded with the multi-dimensional coding scheme \ndescribed in the previous
        section. As described above, the coding scheme is composed of 7 dimensions,
        named \nepistemic, microlevel of argumentation, macrolevel of argumentation,
        social modes, reaction, treatment check, \nand quoted respectively. Each of
        these dimensions has a set of 2 or more categories associated with it. For
        example, macrolevel of argumentation has 7 (six theoretical and one \u201crest\u201d
        category) such categories, whereas \nmicrolevel of argumentation has 5 (four
        theoretical and one \u201crest\u201d category), and epistemic has 35 (thirty-four
        \ntheoretical and one \u201crest\u201d category). The \u201crest\u201d categories
        comprise prompts and quoted text. Every text \nsegment in the gold standard
        corpus is labeled with a category for each of the 7 dimensions. Our \nexperimentation
        followed a typical pattern for corpus based research, which we describe in
        this section. In other \nwords, we form hypotheses about what might work based
        on our understanding of the coding scheme and our \nexperience with the machine
        learning algorithms. We then run experiments with those algorithms and use
        the \nresults to deepen our understanding of the representation and the interaction
        between the machine learning \ntechniques and the data. We then revise our
        hypotheses and run additional experiments. We experimented with a \nrange
        of techniques in a semi-directed manner. It is this semi-directed experimentation
        process that we are \nworking towards automating in our continued research.
        We believe that if we could automate this process, we \nwill have found the
        final piece of the puzzle that is required to make this technology fully accessible
        to CSCL \nresearchers so that it could be applied to new problems without
        the aid of an experienced computational linguist. \nWe began our experimentation
        by testing a non-binary classifier called K-Nearest Neighbors to assign a
        \ncategory to each text for each of the seven dimensions. The difference between
        a binary classifier and a non-\nbinary classifier is that binary classifiers
        can only distinguish between two categories (i.e., positive examples \nversus
        negative examples), a non-binary classifier can in theory make any number
        of distinctions (e.g., the 35 \ntypes of epistemological categories). Since
        the majority of the 7 dimensions that are part of our coding scheme \ncontain
        more than two distinctions, a non-binary classifier was the most straightforward
        approach to use as a \nbaseline. We tested this approach using what is called
        a cross-validation evaluation methodology. What this \nmeans is that we divided
        our gold-standard corpus into 10 equal subsets of coded spans of text. For
        each of \nthese 10 subsets of data, we trained a model from the other nine
        subsets and tested on the selected subset so that \nwe were always testing
        on a different set of data than what we trained on. Each of these rounds of
        training and \ntesting are referred to as an iteration. So there are 10 iterations
        of training and testing for a 10-fold cross-\nvalidation evaluation such as
        this.  This process is important for obtaining an accurate measure of how
        well a \ntrained model will perform on additional data since it keeps a separation
        between data used for training the \nmodel and data used for testing the model.
        Once we had a measure of performance over each of the 10 subsets \nof data,
        we averaged those in order to obtain an estimate for the whole set. Cross-validation
        evaluations are \nstandard practice in machine learning research. We went
        through this process separately for each of the 7 \ndimensions. The results
        are presented in Table 5. The non-binary classifier only achieved an acceptable
        level of \nagreement with the gold standard in the case of reaction, achieving
        a Kappa of .81. \n \nTable 5: Performance of Non-binary classifier over data

        began to experiment with \nbinary classifiers. There is a much wider range
        of non-binary classifiers to choose from. For each category along \neach dimension
        we computed a Kappa value for a wide range of binary classifiers, each of
        which was given the \ntask if distinguishing example texts that are assigned
        the corresponding category along its associated dimension \nand those that
        are not. We noticed that some categories were much easier to predict than
        others. Normally, it \nwas the categories for which there were more than 25
        examples in the corpus. Thus, we hypothesized that an \napproach where we
        cascaded the binary classifiers so that we first applied the most accurate
        classifiers and then \nthe less accurate classifiers only if the accurate
        ones did not predict a positive match would be more accurate. \nAgain we adopted
        a cross-validation methodology. This time it was necessary to select on each
        iteration of \nthe 10-fold cross-validation evaluation, not only a testing
        set, but also a validation set on which to determine the \nrank ordering of
        the individual binary classifiers. This is so that the set used for rank ordering
        the binary \nclassifiers is not either the same set that they were trained
        over, nor the same set they will be tested over. This \nensures both optimal
        training and most accurate testing. Thus, on each iteration, we trained a
        separate binary \nclassifier for each category associated with each dimension
        over 8 subsets of data. We then tested the accuracy \nof these classifiers
        on the validation set. For each dimension, we rank ordered the binary classifiers
        according to \ntheir accuracy over the validation set. We then applied them
        in rank order over the test set, selecting as an \nassigned code the first
        binary classifier that indicated a positive match for an example text. We
        computed the \naccuracy of the cascaded classifier over each of the 10 test
        sets using this approach and then averaged the results as in the first experiment
        with non-binary classifiers. The assumption here is that if one classifier
        gives a higher \nKappa value over the validation set, then it will most likely
        be more reliable in terms of predicting correct labels \nover the testing
        set, hence it is more probable that its prediction is correct instead of the
        classifier with a lower \nKappa. The best results we obtained were with the
        Voted Perceptron Learning algorithm, which gives better \nresults with our
        data in general than the other classification techniques such as DecisionTrees,
        NaiveBayes \napproach, SVM Learning, etc. In the next section we present our
        current best results. \nOUTCOMES \nSince the results for the reaction dimension
        were already acceptable with non-binary classification, we restricted \nour
        experimentation to the remaining 6 dimensions. In all cases we achieved a
        significant increase over the non-\nbinary classification result except in
        the case of the epistemic dimension.  We first present the Kappa we achieve
        \nover the whole corpus using the cascaded approach. We then present the Kappa
        we achieve if we use a more \nconservative approach, only assigning a category
        to the portion of the corpus where our performance over the \nvalidation set
        was highest. The task was accomplished by eliminating the least accurate binary
        classifiers from \nthe cascaded model one by one until an acceptable Kappa
        was achieved. In that column we present the best \nKappa we were able to achieve
        and the percentage of the corpus it was computed over. For example, for the
        \nmacrolevel of argumentation we are able to achieve a Kappa of .83 over 92%
        of the corpus, leaving 8% of the \ncorpus uncoded.  In the case where this
        conservative classifier is used, a human coder only needs to code 8% of \nthe
        corpus by hand since the accuracy over the automatically coded portion of
        the corpus is acceptable. \nTable 7: The table compares the accuracy computed
        in terms of Cohen\u2019s Kappa between the gold standard \ncodes and 3 approaches

        corpus) \nQuoted  .63   .98  .98 (100% of corpus) \n \nAlthough the knowledge
        that is brought to bear on the coding process for the 7 different dimensions
        has \ndifferent requirements (for example, in terms of how much context is
        required or what the distinctions mean \nabout the student\u2019s contribution),
        in all cases except the epistemic dimension the same procedure lead to a \nclassifier
        that achieved a significantly higher level of agreement with the gold standard
        than the non-binary \nclassifier.  Thus, this evaluation demonstrates that
        the cascaded binary classifier has some generality. \nWe plan to continue
        experimenting with alternative classification approaches for the social modes
        and \nepistemic dimensions. Similar to our previous explorations where we
        clustered examples according to similarity \nof coding across the 7 dimensions
        of our coding scheme, we are now exploring the possibility of clustering the
        \ncoded text segments according to similarity of vocabulary distributions
        within text segments.  We predict that \nwithin clusters of similar texts,
        there will be a smaller number of categories for each dimension than over
        the \nwhole set. Thus, we predict that training a classifier over just the
        examples within clusters will be more accurate. \nDISCUSSION \nWe have presented
        and evaluated technology for streamlining the process of multi-dimensional
        analysis of \nthe collaborative learning data. We have argued that such technology
        could potentially have a tremendous \nimpact on this increasingly important
        part of CSCL research. Beyond this community a wide range of other \nbehavioral
        researchers including social scientists, psychologists, and other learning
        scientists and education \nresearchers collect, code, and analyze large quantities
        of natural language corpus data as an important part of \ntheir research.  \nOne
        important outcome from this research is that even sophisticated coding schemes
        such as the 7 \ndimensional coding scheme discussed here that requires several
        weeks of intensive training for a human to apply \nreliably can be largely
        automated. 4 of the 7 dimensions (i.e., macrolevel of argumentation, reaction,
        treatment \ncheck, and quoted) can be applied fully automatically with an
        acceptable level of accuracy, as measured using a cross validation methodology
        over our gold standard coded corpus. Significant portions of the additional
        two \ndimensions (microlevel of argumentation and social modes) can be applied
        fully automatically to a significant \nportion of the data, thus cutting down
        the number of examples that must be coded by a human (an 88% \nreduction in
        the case of microlevel of argumentation dimension and a 25% reduction in the
        case of social modes \ndimension). While the results with epistemic dimension
        were lower, and the Kappa value over the whole set of \ndata was only .51,
        the percent agreement was 80% over the portion of the corpus that received
        a committed \ncode. This is 30% higher than the break even point for time
        savings with checking and correcting automatically \ncoded examples according
        to Ros\u00e9 and colleagues (submitted). Thus, even with this level of accuracy,
        the \nautomatic category predictions can lead to a significant reduction in
        coding time on the epistemic dimension. \nAnother important outcome from this
        research is that the cascaded binary classification approach, which we \nexplore,
        has some generality across multiple dimensions of our coding scheme although
        they are quite different \nin terms of the types and numbers of distinctions
        that must be made. Thus, it is an approach that is likely to be \nreused successfully
        with other coding schemes and eventually be part of an eventual approach to
        automatic \nselection and tuning of machine learning approaches to applying
        categorical coding schemes. \nBeyond improvements to the data analysis that
        is central to our process, automatic coding technology would \nalso enable
        new kinds of instructional interventions. For example, automatic on-line analysis
        of chat interactions \ncould provide instructors with the capability to monitor
        the progress of multiple interactions occurring in \nparallel, indicating
        where the instructor\u2019s intervention is most needed, and even what the
        specific needs are that \nshould be addressed. Further ahead, a fully automatic
        system could also enable automatic adaptive interventions \nfor collaborative
        learning. Those interventions would be more flexible\/adaptive than current
        static interventions. \nFor example, a collaboration script for argument construction
        could be strategically applied when learners do \nnot ground and warrant their
        claims and it could be faded out carefully when learners develop internal
        cognitive \nscripts that guide their argumentative knowledge construction.
        Such a system could prevent effects like over-\nscripting (Dillenbourg, 2004)
        or negative interaction effects between scripts (Kollar \u0026 Fischer, 2004).

        PROBLEM BACKGROUND\u003C\/dc:subject\u003E\u003Cdc:description\u003E\n          Abstract.
        Process analyses are becoming more and more standard in research on computer-supported
        collaborative learning. This paper presents the rational as well as results
        of an evaluation of a tool called TagHelper, designed for streamlining the
        process of multi-dimensional analysis of the collaborative learning process.
        In comparison with a hand-coded corpus coded with a 7 dimensional coding scheme,
        TagHelper is able to achieve an acceptable level of agreement (Cohen\u0026apos;s
        Kappa of.7 or more) along 6 out of 7 of the dimensions when we commit only
        to the portion of the corpus where the predictor has the highest certainty.
        In 5 of those cases, the percentage of the corpus where the predictor is confident
        enough to commit a code is at least 88 % of the corpus. Consequences for theory-building
        with respect to automatic corpus analysis are formulated. Potential applications
        as a support tool for process analyses, as real-time support for facilitators

        Corresponding author    \nAbstract\nBackground: Recent developments within
        the United Kingdom\u0027s (UK) health care system have re-\nawakened interest
        in community hospitals (CHs) and their role in the provision of health care.
        This\nintegrative literature review sought to identify and assess the current
        evidence base for CHs.\nMethods: A range of electronic reference databases
        were searched from January 1984 to either\nDecember 2004 or February 2005:
        Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, BNI, CINAHL, HMIC, ASSIA,\nPsychInfo, SIGLE,
        Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane Library, Kings Fund website, using both keywords
        and\ntext words. Thematic analysis identified recurrent themes across the
        literature; narrative analyses were\nwritten for each theme, identifying unifying
        concepts and discrepant issues.\nResults: The search strategy identified over
        16,000 international references. We included papers of any\nstudy design focussing
        on hospitals in which care was led principally by general practitioners or
        nurses.\nPapers from developing countries were excluded. A review of titles
        revealed 641 potentially relevant\nreferences; abstract appraisal identified
        161 references for review. During data extraction, a further 48\npapers were
        excluded, leaving 113 papers in the final review. The most common methodological\napproaches
        were cross-sectional\/descriptive studies, commentaries and expert opinion.
        There were few\nexperimental studies, systematic reviews, economic studies
        or studies that reported on longer-term\noutcomes. The key themes identified
        were origin and location of CHs; their place in the continuum of care;\nservices
        provided; effectiveness, efficiency and equity of CHs; and views of patients
        and staff.\nIn general, there was a lack of robust evidence for the role of
        CHs, which is partly due to the ad hoc nature\nof their development and lack
        of clear strategic vision for their future. Evidence for the effectiveness
        and\nefficiency of the services provided was limited. Most people admitted
        to CHs appeared to be older,\nsuggesting that admittance to CHs was age-related
        rather than condition-related.\nConclusion: Overall the literature surveyed
        was long on opinion and short of robust studies on CHs.\nWhile lack of evidence
        on CHs does not imply lack of effect, there is an urgent need to develop a
        research\nagenda that addresses the key issues of health care delivery in
        the CH setting.\nPublished: 21 December 2006\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:309

        policy developments within the National Health\nService (NHS) in the United
        Kingdom (UK) have empha-\nsised the need to bring services closer to home,
        with pri-\nmary care increasingly acknowledged as the means of\ndelivering
        population-based public health initiatives [1-\n4]. Such rhetoric needs to
        be matched with service re-\ndesign programmes that effectively and appropriately
        tar-\nget health services nearer to the communities that they\nserve. This
        decentralised approach has been driven by a\nvariety of factors including
        an aging population, difficulty\nin recruitment and retention of health care
        professionals\nand changes in working hours as a result of the EU (Euro-\npean
        Union) Working Time Directive, which stipulates\nthe maximum working week
        for EU occupations includ-\ning medical practitioners [5]. A range of service
        delivery\nmodels have been mooted, including nurse-led telephone\nservices,
        on-line facilities, walk-in centres and the delivery\nof secondary care services
        (e.g. minor surgery, injury care\nand diagnostic facilities), in a primary
        or community-\nbased setting. This has raised the profile of a neglected\nmodel
        of service delivery, the community hospital (CH),\nand led to decisions in
        the UK to reinvest in such a model\nof care [4,6,7]. However, the evidence
        to support their\nstrategic role is unclear [8-11].\nExplicit definitions
        of what a CH is, in terms of organisa-\ntion, service delivery or public health
        function, were hard\nto find. Several currently exist, all derived from UK
        litera-\nture (Table 1). Common to all these definitions is the\nnotion that
        care is led by family doctors, known as general\npractitioners (GPs) with
        their own GP beds, although\nconsultant long-stay beds, primary care nurse-led
        and\nmidwifery services may also feature, and that services are\ndelivered
        locally to the patient. Beyond that, the services\nthat may be offered are
        varied and can include not only\ninpatient facilities, but also outpatient,
        diagnostic, day\ncare, primary care and outreach services for patients pro-\nvided
        by multidisciplinary teams.\nIn light of renewed health policy interest in
        CHs, this lack\nof agreement on their role of and services raises a number\nof
        pertinent questions (Table 2). In order to address these,\nwe conducted an
        integrative thematic review of the litera-\nture from 1984 to February 2005.
        This approach was cho-\nsen as an initial scoping of the literature highlighted
        the\ndiversity of published evidence with many studies utilis-\ning qualitative
        approaches and few using comparative\nmethodologies such as randomised controlled
        trials, ren-\ndering a Cochrane-style systematic review based on hier-\narchies
        of evidence inappropriate [12,13].\nMethods\nWe searched Medline, Embase,
        Web of Knowledge\n(including Science Citation Index \u0026 Social Science
        Cita-\ntion Index), British Nursing Index, Cinahl, Health Man-\nagement Information
        Consortium (HMIC), ASSIA,\nPsychInfo, SIGLE, Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane\nLibrary
        Issue 3 and the King\u0027s Fund website [14] to iden-\ntify published and
        grey literature. Databases (Table 3)\nwere searched from 1984 to either December
        2004 or Feb-\nruary 2005, depending on availability. Table 3 lists the\nsearch
        terms, which included \u0022community hospital\u0022,\n\u0022cottage hospital\u0022
        and \u0022general practitioner hospital\u0022.\nUtilising the definitions
        of CHs described in Table 1, we\nincluded studies or reports set in hospitals
        in which care\nwas principally led by family practitioners (GPs) or\nnurses.
        Papers were also included in which visiting con-\nsultants provided secondary
        care or operating time in a\nCH. Hospitals with only specialist beds (e.g.
        geriatric\nlong-stay) were not considered to fit the CH definition.\nHowever,
        social work establishments, such as a care\nhome, were included if they also
        had GP beds. Diagnostic\nand treatment centres were not considered to be within\nthe
        scope of this review, as they related more to the deliv-\nery of a secondary
        care function in a primary care setting.\nAll study designs were included,
        as well policy documents\nand non-research based reports such as letters and
        edito-\nrials. Papers from developing countries were excluded, as\nwere non-English
        language papers.\nTwo reviewers assessed each of the titles for eligibility.\nDisagreements
        were resolved by discussion. A third\nTable 1: Definitions of community hospitals.\n\u0022A
        general practitioner community hospital can be defined as a hospital where
        the admission, care and discharge of patients is under the direct \ncontrol
        of a general practitioner who is paid for this service through a bed fund,
        or its equivalent.\u0022 [8]\n\u0022A local hospital, unit or centre providing
        an appropriate range and format of accessible health care facilities and resources.
        These will include \ninpatient and may include outpatient, diagnostic, day
        care, primary care and outreach services for patients provided by multidisciplinary
        teams. \nMedical care is normally led by general practitioners in liaison
        with consultants, nursing and allied health professional colleagues, as necessary,
        \nConsultant long stay beds, primary care nurse-led and midwife services may
        also be incorporated\u0022 [9]\n\u0022Community hospitals are local hospitals,
        units or centres whose role is to provide accessible health are and associated
        services to meet the needs \nof a clinically defined and local population
        As an extension of primary care they enable GPs and primary health care teams
        to support people within \ntheir one communities. Community hospitals play
        a major role in rehabilitation and also offer palliative care, health promotion,
        diagnostic, \nemergency, acute and therapeutic services.\u0022 [18]\n\u0022The
        general practitioner community hospital is one dominated by a primary care
        orientation in which patient selection, admission and management \nare all
        under the direct supervision of the general practitioner. These hospitals
        serve a confined geographical locality ....\u0022 [25]Page 2 of 11\n(page

        was consulted if consensus was not reached. Four\nreviewers then appraised
        the abstracts and keywords of\npotentially eligible papers for inclusion,
        scoring the refer-\nence according to suitability (0 \u2013 exclude, 1 \u2013
        uncertain, 2\n\u2013 include). Papers scoring 7 or 8, i.e. graded for inclusion\nby
        at least three reviewers and graded as uncertain by the\nfourth reviewer,
        were included in the final group of eligi-\nble papers.\nTwo reviewers abstracted
        data from eligible studies using\na specifically designed data extraction
        tool previously\npiloted on 10 papers. Data extraction was in two stages:\n(1)
        details of the paper, setting, methods, aims and con-\nclusions were recorded;
        and (2) each paper was assessed\nfor content in relation to pre-defined themes
        based on the\nresearch brief and a preliminary review of the literature.\nThese
        research themes reflected the questions posed in\nTable 2 and included: origin,
        number and geographical\nlocation; current role and place in health care provision;\nrange
        of services offered and their effectiveness; interface\nbetween primary and
        secondary care; views of staff,\npatients and the wider community.\nThe development
        of the thematic review was guided by\nthe methodological literature, which
        indicated that the-\nmatic analysis should involve the identification of prom-\ninent
        or recurrent themes, summarised under each\nthematic heading [12,13]. The
        content of these headings\nwas used to identify and define overarching thematic
        cat-\negories, leading to a greater understanding of the topic.\nThus, members
        of the research team read the relevant lit-\nerature identified under each
        thematic focus, identifying\nboth unifying concepts within each theme and
        discrepant\nissues. These were used to construct a narrative analysis\nfor
        each theme. These were then reviewed across each\ntheme, again to identify
        possible unifying concepts.\nTable 3: Bibliographic databases searched and

        2006, 6:309 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/309Results\nWe identified
        161 potentially useful citations. Full copies\nwere obtained for 158 of these
        and 113 included in the\nthematic review (Figure 1). Of the 45 excluded, the
        main\nreason was that, on review, they were not primarily con-\ncerned with
        GP or nurse-led CHs. Most of the included\npapers originated from the UK,
        which may be a reflection\nof the UK definitions used to define CHs. While
        references\nfrom the USA were not specifically excluded, the criteria of\nbeing
        principally led by GPs or nurses led to the exclusion\nof most US literature.
        Most papers were descriptive or\ncommentaries and there were very few studies
        employing:\n(a) an experimental design; (b) explicitly systematic\nreviews;
        or (c) economic studies (Table 4). Only one study\nreported on longer-term
        outcomes. Included studies are\ndetailed in the additional file [see Additional
        file 1].\nOrigin, number and geographical location\nCHs have been a key part
        of health care provision both\npre- and post-NHS, often evolving from cottage
        hospitals\nbuilt in the latter part of the 19th century. Planning of CHs\nwas
        ad hoc, reflecting history rather than any rational\nplanning [15-18].\nFew
        reports detailed the current extent of CHs, either in\nterms of number or
        location. Two reported on the number\nof CHs in the UK, showing that numbers
        had increased\nfrom 455 in 1998 [18] to 471 in 2001 [19]. CHs appeared\nto
        be an integral part of health care provision in many\nrural areas [20], with
        Seamark reporting their mean dis-\ntance from a district general hospital
        to be 21 miles for\nmainland Scotland and 14 miles for the rest of the UK\n[19].
        GP beds were also a feature of health care provision\nin Finland, where most
        health districts had a \u0022health sta-\ntion\u0022 with in-patient beds.
        While the overall use of these\nbeds was 30% acute general medical care and
        70%\nchronic or geriatric care, this proportion varied with dis-\ntance from
        central specialist hospitals, with more acute\ncare in the more remote areas
        [21].\nAs could be expected from Seamark\u0027s finding on distance\n[19],
        CHs were rare in urban areas, i.e. only four studies\nreported on three urban
        CHs (all in London) [22-25].\nThese provided acute medical care, observation,
        post-\noperative care, convalescence, rehabilitation and carer\nrelief.\nCHs
        in health care provision\nThere was no single view of where CHs should sit
        in the\ncontinuum of care. For some, CHs were viewed as a step-\ndown facility
        easing pressure on acute care services [26]\nand facilitating earlier transfer
        from acute hospitals [27].\nConversely, CHs could provide care more intensively
        than\nat home, but without moving patients to a higher inten-\nsity care setting,
        such as a district general hospital\n[26,28,29]. In this way, CHs functioned
        as an extension of\nprimary care, contributing to acute, terminal and elderly\ncare,
        as well respite care and rehabilitation services.\nSeveral papers explored
        the role of CHs as local alterna-\ntives to secondary care, although these
        were mainly audits\nor cross-sectional surveys. An audit of surgery in CHs\nshowed
        that surgeons operate in a CH setting with low\nrates of complications, but
        emphasised the need for liai-\nson and co-operation between the CH and district
        general\nhospital [30]. CHs were also found to have a role in palli-\native
        care [31-33], with cancer-related deaths in other set-\ntings (district general
        hospital, hospice, nursing home or\nhome) reduced where GPs had access to
        CH beds [32].\nCHs were also used to provide cancer-related day surgery,\nincluding
        removal of skin cancers and breast excision\nbiopsies, although it was unclear
        if this work was carried\nout by GPs or by hospital specialists working in
        the CH\nsetting [33].\nRange of services offered and their effectiveness\nA
        questionnaire to all CHs in the UK [19] identified a\ndiverse range of services
        on offer (Table 5). Most reported\nstudies focussed on obstetric care; geriatric
        care; accident\n\u0026 emergency (A\u0026E) and unscheduled care (including
        the\nuse of telemedicine); intermediate care; palliative care;\nand surgery.\nMaternity
        care\nWe identified evaluations of one GP\/midwife-led unit\nfrom the 1980s
        [34,35]. In terms of perinatal mortality,\nthe unit compared well with the
        local maternity unit after\nadjustment for case-mix, but differences in standards
        of\ncare in terms of monitoring and interventions were evi-\ndent. A questionnaire
        of women cared for in a community\nmaternity unit suggested that they were
        more satisfied\nwith their care than women attending a district general\nhospital;
        however this study did not adjust for case mix\nnor did it present clinical
        outcome data [36].\nCardiac care\nThere was limited evidence from New Zealand
        (NZ) to\nsupport the ability of CHs to deliver acute cardiac care\nwith the
        support of specialists [37]. Here, mortality fol-\nlowing acute myocardial
        infarction was comparable to\nthat of a large central hospital but, again,
        there was no\nadjustment for case mix. A German study of chronic car-\ndiac
        care found that heart failure management according\nto current guidelines,
        use of beta-blockers and ACE inhib-\nitors, and invasive cardiac examination
        was performed\nsignificantly less in the rural CH than in the metropolitan\nheart
        center [38].Page 4 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public

        care\nAn audit of services in one region of Scotland against pal-\nliative
        care standards developed nationally showed sub-\nstantial variations between
        CHs and shortfalls against\nmany of the standards [39].\nCare of older people\nThis
        was often identified as a major function of CHs\n[18,26]. However, again,
        there was a marked lack of evi-\ndence of effectiveness. Two papers compared
        care of older\npeople in CHs to that in larger district general hospitals\n[40,41].
        Discharge rates, quality of life and mortality at 6\nmonths were similar in
        both settings. However, an audit\nof nutritional services highlighted marked
        differences in\ncare delivery in terms of care plans and observed practices\nbetween
        CHs and district general hospitals, with deficien-\ncies noted in the CHs
        [42].\nUse of telemedicine links\nTelemedicine services were provided in some
        settings,\nmainly for Accident and Emergency (A\u0026E) and minor\ninjuries,
        linking GPs and minor injuries unit nurses to\nA\u0026E specialists [43-47].
        Again, there were no comparison\ngroups to evaluate the effectiveness of the
        care provided.\nEfficiency of community hospitals\nEfficiency was presented
        in the literature in terms of bed\nuse, length of stay and cost, but not in
        relation to final\nhealth outcomes, e.g. life years gained or quality adjusted\nlife
        years.\nBed use\nSeveral studies described occupied bed days in CHs [48-\n51].
        All reported reductions in admissions to general hos-\npitals where GPs had
        access to CH beds (Table 6).\nRound and colleagues [52] reported that, after
        adjusting\nfor deprivation, other forms of residential care, distance\nfrom
        a district general hospital and morbidity, access to\nCHs accounted for 3.9
        additional admissions per 1,000\npopulation per year. So, while CHs may reduce
        admis-\nsions to other healthcare facilities, overall admission rates\nTable

        be higher where CHs are available. However, no\nwork examined the appropriateness
        of the admissions.\nLength of stay\nNo studies compared length of stay in
        CHs with other\nmodels of care. There was limited evidence that length of\nstay
        was reduced when GPs co-ordinated the admission\ncompared with consultants
        [27,53]. However, differences\nin case mix or appropriateness of care were
        not addressed.\nEconomic evaluation\nCoast et al [54] estimated the cost saving
        (at 1994 prices)\nof an admission to a GP hospital at $72 \u2013 $144 (\u00a347
        \u2013\n\u00a394) per admission, with the potential to divert 5.6 \u2013\n8.4%
        of admissions to general medicine and geriatric spe-\ncialties. McKinlay [40]
        reported savings of $49 \u2013 $62 (\u00a330\n\u2013 \u00a338) per patient
        per day compared to a district general\nhospital at 1991 prices. A Norwegian
        study also con-\ncluded that the costs of GP hospital care were lower than\ndistrict
        general care [55]. These cost-minimisation studies\nassumed equivalence of
        outcome.\nHenderson and Scott [56] constructed a model of the eco-\nnomic
        impact of different patterns of care post-acute\nstroke and found that it
        was likely that admission to the\nCH in preference to a district general hospital
        would\nreduce overall costs of care. They concluded that it was\npossible
        to produce as good clinical outcomes in a com-\nmunity setting as in a district
        general hospital, given\nappropriate organisation of care. For a population
        of\n13,500, the reduction (at 2000 prices) was approximately\n$165,408 (\u00a3109,000)
        per year. Their analysis was subject\nto numerous assumptions, but did suggest
        savings to the\nNHS. Costs to relatives were not examined; societal sav-\nings
        may have accrued by reducing travel costs to families.\nEquity\nThere was
        wide variation in access to CHs, across both\nrural and urban areas, even
        for people registered with GP\npractices with access to CH beds [51].\nEquity
        does not only relate to geographical access: it also\ndepends on the extent
        to which people with similar prob-\nlems are treated in similar ways. However,
        most of the\npeople admitted to CH in the studies reviewed were older,\nsuggesting
        that admittance to CHs and the nature of care\nreceived was age-related rather
        than condition-related.\nViews of patients and staff\nMost papers were cross-sectional,
        one-off surveys, using\nquestionnaires of unproven validity. Studies were
        local-\nised in nature, with small sample sizes.\nPatient satisfaction levels
        with the care provided by CHs\nwere usually high [25,30,36,44,57,58]. Benefits
        included\nease of access, knowing staff and being cared for in a\nfriendly
        atmosphere. Staff satisfaction was also high\n[36,58-60]. Benefits, according
        to staff, included conven-\nience for patients, continuity of care, gain in
        knowledge\nand professional satisfaction. One exception was at a\ncommunity
        midwife unit, where GPs were concerned\nabout complications arising during
        labour and the risk\nthis could present [36].\nStaffing\nThere were no papers
        focussing on the existing workforce\nor skill base, range of roles or training
        requirements of\nstaff working in CHs. Table 7 shows the range of profes-\nsional
        groups working in a CH setting, drawn from the\nidentified literature.\nThere
        was evidence that professional boundaries were\nflexible in the CH setting,
        with role diversification appar-\nent, especially for nurses [61-67]. This
        diversification of\nroles often challenged existing professional boundaries\nand,
        at its most extreme, could lead to breakdowns in\ncommunication with overall
        patient care suffering [62].\nOpportunities for mutual learning and addressing
        struc-\ntural and organisational barriers, such as inflexible con-\ntractual
        terms and conditions, can overcome these\nperceived divides [68]. The need
        for additional training\nTable 6: Comparison occupied bed days in practices

        support was also highlighted in some papers, particu-\nlarly for those practising
        in rural setting [47,69]. In Aus-\ntralia, joint academic posts between rural
        CHs and central\nacademic units had been developed in order to improve\nrecruitment
        and retention [69]\nThe societal impact of CHs\nThere was no literature on
        the societal impact of CHs.\nDiscussion\nAn extensive search of the evidence
        base for CHs identi-\nfied a literature that was long on opinion and short
        of\nrobust studies. However, it is important to stress that lack\nof evidence
        on CHs does not necessarily equate to a lack\nof effect.\nThe search and inclusion
        criteria were based on defini-\ntions of CHs as a setting where care is provided
        principally\nby GPs or by nurses. These definitions all originated from\nUK
        literature and so may be most relevant to health care\nsystems organised in
        a similar manner to the NHS, where\nfamily practitioners act as a gatekeepers
        to specialist serv-\nices, e.g. European countries such as Denmark and the\nNetherlands
        [70]. This focus on care led by GPs or nurses\nalso led to the exclusion of
        a body of literature from the\nUSA. However, there was literature from a range
        of other\nsettings including Scandinavia and NZ. Thus, the findings\nare applicable
        to settings out with the UK.\nThere was no consensus as to where CHs sit in
        the contin-\nuum of care. They appeared to function both as a location\nto
        which patients requiring less intensive treatment could\nbe discharged from
        acute care, prior to returning to the\ncommunity; or as a site whereby more
        intensive care or\nrespite care could be provided without resorting to admis-\nsion
        to a more specialised hospital. Thus, CHs appear\ncapable of functioning as
        a truly intermediate care site,\nproviding care packages that are too complex
        for a patient\nto remain at home, but can also act as a location for\npatients
        who no longer require specialised care in the\nacute sector. This lack of
        consensus as to their location\nwithin the NHS may account for the lack of
        strategic direc-\ntion and planning for CHs and also for the lack of detail\nregarding
        the organisational attributes and structure of\nexisting CHs.\nThis also explains
        the range of services offered by CHs and\nthe difficulty of judging the effectiveness
        of those services.\nFew studies adequately addressed the issue of effective-\nness.
        The studies that did exist reported limited evidence\nof differences with
        specialised hospital care and outcomes\nfor selected patient groups. However,
        comparisons were\noften limited and adjustments for case mix were not clear.\nSome
        studies appeared too small to identify any differ-\nence in outcomes. Differences
        in reasons for referral or\nadmission to a district or specialised hospital
        rather than\na CH, were generally not considered in studies. These\nweaknesses
        in the evidence suggest that it is not possible\nfor opponents of CHs to mount
        a sustained argument that\ncare is of a poorer quality in CHs than for the
        same groups\ntreated in a district general or specialised hospital.\nEqually,
        there was little evidence that demonstrates equiv-\nalence of care in the
        two settings. However, this absence of\nevidence should not be taken as evidence
        of a lack of effec-\nTable 7: Professional groups working in a CH setting\nProfessional

        ad hoc development and lack of plan-\nning of CHs, evaluation has been equally
        ad hoc. Lack of\nevidence of effectiveness reflects the lack of planned and\nsystematic
        evaluation as well as uncertainty about the\naims and role of the CHs.\nEvidence
        of cost-effectiveness was even more sparse and\nbased on the assumption that
        outcomes in CHs were\nequivalent to those in other settings. Of the two most\ndetailed
        studies, one concluded that there was inadequate\ninformation to make a clear
        judgment, while the other\nargued that CH involvement would be cost-saving.
        Stud-\nies usually examined average bed day costs, and did not\ntake into
        account fixed costs in district general hospitals\nthat would not be offset
        by increases in CH activity.\nPatients and staff appeared generally satisfied
        with care\ndelivered in CHs, citing ease of access, continuity of care\nand
        knowledge of the staff as import factors. However,\nthere was no discussion
        of the wider role that CHs may\nplay in the society in which they are located.
        This is sur-\nprising, given their rural location, and the importance that\nhealth
        care practitioners may play in sustaining rural com-\nmunities [71]. There
        was also almost no discussion of the\nfuture role that CHs may play in the
        provision of health\ncare, for example as a location for unscheduled and out-\nof-hours
        care or as centres of telemedicine.\nThe challenges to research on CHs are
        substantial. Num-\nbers are often low; randomisation is difficult or impossi-\nble;
        variation between hospitals is large; and there may be\nlack of agreement
        on appropriate outcomes measures. The\nnature of care provided in CHs makes
        measurement of\noutcome difficult, as measures should be generic, holistic\nand
        take a societal perspective. There are, however,\nnumerous possible research
        routes to answer questions\non clinical and cost-effectiveness, community
        impact and\nsustainability, combining qualitative and quantitative\nmethods.
        We have thus identified a number of issues\nabout the current variation in
        the structure and provision\nof CHs in different contexts, and their place
        in the future\ndelivery of services (Table 8).\nConclusion\nThe development
        of closer integration between health\nand social care, particularly in the
        UK, suggest that the\nstrengths of CHs, linking primary and secondary care
        and\nproviding a location for the delivery of complex packages\nof health
        and social care and public health, could be uti-\nlised further. This review
        indicates that research evidence\non CHs could inform a clear national policy
        on their role,\nand benefit both the sector in its attempts to continue to\nadapt
        and health service planning in the NHS at large.\nCompeting interests\nThe

        and evaluation.\nIs the variation in the composition of CHs acceptable?\nDoes
        the care provided in CHs map against local health care need?\nHave CHs been
        constructed around the skills available in the local health economy, rather
        than the needs of patients?\nCan delivery in CHs adapt or are they inflexible
        as structures in the local health economy?\nDo CHs have a place in the resign
        of services?\nCan they act as a buffer against the centralisation of care?\nThere
        are large parts of rural Scotland without CH provision. Is that acceptable?\nCould
        these areas be used for comparative studies?\nAre there other methods of bolstering
        the delivery of primary care in rural areas?\nDo primary care beds need to
        be located in CHs?\nIs there a role for urban CHs?Page 9 of 11\n(page number

        Corpus analysis, automatic text processing techniques, argumentation \nPROBLEM
        BACKGROUND \nIncreasingly, research in CSCL addresses quantitative process
        analysis through multi-dimensional coding \nschemes (e.g., Fischer, Bruhn,
        Gr\u00e4sel, \u0026 Mandl, 2002; Lally \u0026 De Laat, 2002). The process
        of collaboration is \nseen as a mediator between the computer-supported instructional
        settings and cognitive processes. Often only \ndetailed process analyses reveal
        plausible interpretations of the effects of CSCL environments (Weinberger,
        \n2003). Conducting detailed process analyses involves applying categorical
        coding schemes along multiple \ndimensions, each of which indicate something
        different about the text segment\u2019s function within the \ncollaborative
        discourse. For example, Lally and De Laat (2002) code for activities along
        six dimensions \nincluding cognitive, meta-cognitive, affective, design, discourse
        maintenance, and direct instruction. Multi-\ndimensional coding schemes like
        these encode much more information than frameworks in which each text \nsegment
        is coded with a single category.  However, while single dimensional analyses
        can be expedited by \nrequiring participants to select contribution openers
        that are indicative of contribution function, this is not \npractical with
        multi-dimensional coding. Furthermore, applying multi-dimensional categorical
        coding schemes \nby hand is extremely time intensive for three reasons. First,
        developing the coding schemes themselves in such a \nway that human coders
        can apply them reliably is a lengthy process requiring much iteration. Second,
        \nsophisticated coding schemes may require a high skill level and intensive
        training before coders can apply a \nwell-designed coding scheme with high
        reliability. Thus, training time for learning a new coding scheme is \nanother
        source of time expense involved in this type of research. Finally, applying
        coding schemes as part of the \nanalysis process itself is a tedious and time
        consuming process. Surprisingly, although structured editors often \nsupport
        this work, other times it is done by pen and paper. We therefore conducted
        a study to find out the degree \nto which automatic classification technology
        can be successfully used to automate the challenging task of multi-\ndimensional
        quantitative process analysis.  \nIn this paper we present results of an evaluation
        study of the TagHelper technology for supporting and \nstreamlining the process
        of multi-dimensional analysis of the collaborative learning process. We begin
        by \ncontextualizing our technological explorations within a high profile
        CSCL environment. We then review related \nwork and explain how our work is
        unique and complementary to previous automatic analysis work within the \nCSCL
        community. We then describe our exploration process and the details of our
        evaluation. We conclude \nwith discussion and current directions. MOTIVATION
        \nThe main question addressed in this paper is the extent to which automatic
        classification technology can be used \nto automate the task of multi-dimensional
        quantitative process analysis. Addressing this question, we first \npresent
        a promising approach to this challenging task - TagHelper technology. Then
        we report on major results \nof an evaluation study of TagHelper in the context
        of a high profile CSCL project. In this project, a multi-\ndimensional coding
        scheme is applied to massive amounts of discourse data in order to examine
        the process of \ncollaboration under different instructional conditions.  \nWithin
        the context of this project, a series of experimental studies were conducted
        that aimed to address the \nquestion of how computer-supported collaboration
        scripts could foster argumentative knowledge construction in \nonline discussions.
        Argumentative knowledge construction is based on the perspective of cognitive
        elaboration, \nthe idea that learners acquire knowledge through argumentation
        with one or more learning partners (Baker, \n2003; Dillenbourg, 2004). Computer-supported
        collaboration scripts apply on specific dimensions of \nargumentative knowledge
        construction, e.g., a script for argument construction could support learners
        to ground \nand warrant their claims (Kollar, Fischer, \u0026 Hesse, 2003;
        Stegmann, Weinberger, Fischer, \u0026 Mandl, 2004) or a \nsocial collaboration
        script can support conflict orientation (Weinberger, 2003). These and other
        computer-\nsupported collaboration scripts were varied experimentally (see
        Stegmann et al., 2004; Weinberger, 2003; \nWeinberger, Fischer, \u0026 Mandl,
        submitted for more detailed process analyses).  These studies were conducted
        in \nthree waves. The first wave took place in the winter of 2000\/2001, the
        second in the winter of 2002\/2003, and \nthe third in the winter of 2003\/2004.
        The complete process analysis comprises about 200 discussions of about \n600
        participants with altogether more than 17,000 coded text segments. Trained
        coders categorized each \nsegment using a multi-dimensional coding scheme
        (see below). \nThree groups of about six coders, one group for each wave,
        were trained to apply the coding scheme to the \ncollected corpus. One and
        the same trainer advised the analysts during all of the three waves. Each
        coder \nreceived a booklet with a detailed description of the coding scheme
        including all coding rules and examples for \neach category to ensure coding
        reliability. The training consisted of a combination of group meetings, dyadic
        \npractice, and individual practice. At regular intervals the reliability
        of the coding was computed by means of \nCohen\u2019s Kappa.  Discrepancies
        were then discussed and resolved. Between the training and the coding itself,
        \none quarter of the total duration of the research project was used for the
        coding of collaborative processes. In \nparticular, the training for each
        group of coders requires about several weeks, or about 500 working hours \ncompletely
        dedicated to the training process. The coding itself took about one month
        per wave, or about 1200 \nworking hours.  \nObviously a fully-automatic or
        even semi-automatic system, which could support coding of natural language
        \ncorpus data, e.g., from computer-supported text-based communication, would
        facilitate and potentially improve \nquantitative process analyses in multiple
        ways. First of all, the number of working hours could be dramatically \nreduced
        for both training and coding. The role of the analysts could be reduced to
        simply checking the automatic \ncoding and making corrections if necessary.
        Thus, the level of expertise of the coders could potentially be \nreduced,
        which would further reduce the cost. The coding itself would be faster.  As
        learning processes could be \nanalyzed promptly, even on the fly, facilitators
        could quickly identify specific deficits of collaborative learners \nas they
        are interacting and offer specific instructional support at key points. \nOVERVIEW
        OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY \nRichards (1999), Soller \u0026 Lesgold (2000) and
        Goodman et al. (to appear) present work on automatically \nmodeling the process
        of collaborative learning by detecting sequences of speech acts that indicate
        either success \nor failure in the collaborative process. The automatic analysis
        presented in this previous CSCL work builds upon \nan already completed categorical
        analysis of the text. These analyses can be thought of as meta-analyses with
        \nrespect to the type of analysis we speak of. In contrast, the analysis that
        we present in this paper is based on the \nraw text contributed by the participants
        in the collaborative learning scenarios. What is different about our \napproach
        is that we start with the raw text and detect features within the text itself
        that are diagnostic of different \nlocal aspects of the collaboration. Thus,
        rather than presenting a competing approach, we present an approach \nthat
        is complementary to that presented in prior work. \nCurrently there is a wide
        range of corpus analysis tools used to support corpus analysis work either
        at a very \nlow level (e.g., word frequency statistics, collocational analyses,
        etc.) or at a high level (e.g., exploratory \nsequential data analysis once
        a corpus has been coded with a categorical coding scheme), but no tools to
        support \nthe time consuming task of doing the categorical behavioral coding
        or content analysis, although much \napplicable technology developed in the
        language technologies community is already in existence. Content \nanalysis
        includes both categorical analyses as well as more detailed, bottom-up analyses
        where spontaneous, \ninformal observations about verbal behavior are recorded.
        In this paper we address the problem of streamlining \nthe categorical type
        of protocol analysis.   \nFigure 1. Abbreviated overview of some existing
        corpus analysis tools and technology \n \nCurrently, the only existing tools
        to support categorical content analysis are structured editors similar to
        Nb \n(Flammia \u0026 Zue, 1995) and MATE (McKelvie et al., 2000) or a wide
        variety of XML editors. We are exploring \nthe application of state-of-the-art
        dialogue act tagging and text classification technology to enable fully and
        \nsemi-automatic coding.  \nApplying Language Technology to a Previously Unexplored
        Application \nApplying a categorical coding scheme can be thought of as a
        text classification problem where a computer \ndecides which code to assign
        to a text based on a model that it has built based on regularities found from
        \nexamining \u201ctraining examples\u201d that were coded by hand and provided
        to it. A number of such statistical \nclassification and machine learning
        techniques have been applied to text categorization, including regression
        \nmodels (Yang \u0026 Pedersen, 1997), nearest neighbor classifiers (Yang
        \u0026 Pedersen, 1997), decision trees (Lewis \n\u0026 Ringuette), Bayesian
        classifiers (Dumais et al., 1998), Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998),
        rule \nlearning algorithms (Cohen \u0026 Singer, 1996), relevance feedback
        (Rocchio, 1971), voted classification (Weiss et \nal., 1999), and neural networks
        (Wiener et al., 1993).  While these approaches are different in many technical
        \nrespects that are beyond the scope of this paper to describe, they are all
        used in the same way. A wide range of \nsuch machine learning algorithms are
        available in the Minorthird text-learning toolkit (Cohen et al, 2004), which
        \nwe use as a resource for the work reported here. Minorthird is a software
        package that includes a wide range of \nconfigurable machine learning algorithms
        that can be used for text classification experimentation. \nWithin the computational
        linguistics community, a very common type of categorical coding scheme applied
        \nto text is that of speech acts or dialogue acts (Chu-Caroll, 1998; Reithinger
        \u0026 Klessen, 1997). Classifying \nspoken utterances into dialogue acts
        or speech acts has been a common way of characterizing utterance function
        \nsince the 1960s.  We argue that the same basic technology has the potential
        to achieve a much broader impact by \nbecoming more accessible outside the
        computational linguistics community as well as using a broader range of \ncoding
        schemes.  One example of a community where this technology could have a major
        impact is the CSCL \nresearch community where large quantities of natural
        language data are being collected and analyzed \npainstakingly by hand.  \nUnfortunately,
        existing text classification technology is largely inaccessible to CSCL researchers
        who need \nand want semi-automatic tagging support because they do not have
        the background to apply it effectively to \ntheir analysis tasks.  They are
        largely unaware of the wide range of alternative text classification techniques
        that \nare available, and furthermore, they do not possess the technical skills
        required to predict which available \napproaches are likely to be most appropriate
        for their task or to tune an appropriate technique once selected.   \nBridging
        the Gap Between Language Technology and CSCL Research \nThe goal of our current
        work is to bridge the gap found in existing corpus analysis tools used by
        CSCL \nresearchers for analyzing corpus data.  In this paper we focus on the
        highly accurate text classification \ntechnology that enables some categorical
        corpus analysis work to be done totally automatically. In other work \nwe
        have developed and tested an easy-to-use adaptive coding interface (Ros\u00e9
        et al., submitted). The easy-to-use \nTagHelper interface displays its automatic
        predictions about the analysis of each span of text to the analyst in \nthe
        form of an adaptive menu-based interface.  The system\u2019s predictions are
        visible to the analyst as he scans the \npage and modifies only the codes
        that he disagrees with by making an alternative selection. Ros\u00e9 et al.
        (submitted) have evaluated TagHelper\u2019s novel adaptive interface for facilitating
        content analysis \nof corpus data in comparison with an otherwise identical
        non-adaptive interface in terms of speed, validity, and \nreliability of coding.  Since
        deciding to disagree with a predicted code and then choosing a new code takes
        \nlonger than selecting a code from scratch, the advantage in coding speed
        for automatic predictions depends upon \nthe accuracy with which predictions
        can be made. In order to break even with speed, a prediction accuracy of at
        \nleast 50% is required. 50% prediction accuracy leads to an increase in reliability
        and validity of coding.  In an \nevaluation with novice analysts in (Ros\u00e9
        et al., submitted), the top 30% of novice coders working with the \nautomatic
        predictions achieved an average pairwise Kappa agreement measure of .71 in
        comparison with .54 in \nthe unsupported coding condition (P \u003C .05).  Novice
        agreement with a gold standard was marginally higher (P \u003C \n.1) across
        the whole population of coders. A gold standard corpus is a corpus that has
        been coded with a coding \nscheme, and the codes have been verified to be
        reliable. Thus, using automatic coding support, acceptable \nreliability and
        validity of coding can be achieved with novice coders using very little training.
        TagHelper can be \nquickly adapted for a new coding scheme and domain by providing
        only a small corpus of example texts \nencoded in XML and a simple specification
        of the structure of the coding scheme.   \nMETHOD \nIn this paper, we examine
        the feasibility of TagHelper for supporting fully automatic analyses of the
        \nprocesses of argumentative collaborative knowledge construction.  In this
        work, a human was required to \noptimize the selection and tuning of an appropriate
        machine learning algorithm.  However, once a model was \ntrained on the data
        using the selected technique, TagHelper was used to code data in a fully-automatic
        way. \nCoding scheme for argumentative knowledge construction \nIn this section
        we describe a coding scheme that was applied in a project with more than 600
        students of \nEducational Science at the Ludwig-Maximillians university of
        Munich, who participated in groups of three in \nmultiple studies. Students
        in all experimental conditions had to work together in applying theoretical
        concepts to \nthree case problems and jointly prepare an analysis for each
        case by communicating via web-based discussion \nboards. They were asked to
        discuss the three cases against the background of attribution theory (Weiner,
        1985) \nand to jointly compose at least one final analysis for each case,
        i.e. they usually drafted initial analyses, \ndiscussed them, and wrote a
        final analysis. The cases portrayed typical attribution problems of university
        \nstudents, e.g., a student interpreting his failure on an important test.
        All groups collaborated in three discussion \nboards \u2013 one for each case.
        The discussion boards provided a main page with an overview of all message
        \nheaders, which were graphically represented in a discussion thread structure.
        Learners could read the full text of \nall messages, reply to the messages,
        or compose and post new messages. In the replies, the original messages \nwere
        quoted with \u0022\u003E\u0022 as in standard newsreaders and e-mail programs.
        \nThe purpose of our analysis was to model the process of argumentative knowledge
        construction.   \nArgumentative knowledge construction must be evaluated on
        multiple process dimensions (Weinberger \u0026 \nFischer, in press). These
        dimensions are derived from different theoretical approaches and focus on
        different \nconcepts of argumentative knowledge construction. The main concepts
        are (1) epistemic activity, formal quality \nof argumentation, which includes
        (2) microlevel and (3) macrolevel, and (4) social modes of interaction (with
        a \nsub-dimension for (5) reaction). In accordance with the theoretical approach,
        the number of categories differs \nbetween dimensions from 2 (e.g., reaction)
        to 35 (e.g., epistemic). For experimental reasons, there is also a (6) \ntreatment
        check dimension and a (7) quoted dimension. \nOn the (1) epistemic dimension
        (see table 1), argumentative knowledge construction processes are to be \nanalyzed
        with respect to the questions of how learners work on the learning task, e.g.,
        what content they are \nreferring to or applying. One important distinction
        on the epistemic process dimension is to what extent learners \nwork on the
        task or digress off task (Cohen, 1994). In order to solve a problem, learners
        may need to construct a \nproblem space, construct a conceptual space, and
        construct relations between the conceptual and problem \nspaces. With the
        construction of the problem space, learners are to acquire an understanding
        of the problem they \nare supposed to work on. Therefore, learners select
        and relate individual components of the problem case \ninformation. The construction
        of the conceptual space serves to communicate an understanding of a theory.
        \nLearners connect individual theoretical concepts or distinguish them from
        another. The construction of relations \nbetween conceptual and problem space
        indicates to what extent learners are able to apply theoretical concepts \nadequately.
        In particular, learners may apply theoretical concepts that are to be learned,
        apply concepts \nstemming from prior knowledge or also apply wrong concepts.  \nOn
        the formal dimension of argumentation, the processes of argumentative knowledge
        construction can be \nexamined on both a micro- and a macrolevel of representation
        that indicate how learners construct single \narguments and how learners connect
        arguments into sequences. In contrast to the epistemic dimension, the \nformal
        dimension of argumentative knowledge construction is not as concerned with
        what learners are \ncontributing, but how they construct arguments and argumentation
        sequences in order to make their point. \n  \nTable 1: Categories of epistemic

        concepts adequately to solve a problem. Learners \nrelate theoretical concepts
        to case information. A number of concept-case-relations \nmay need to be constructed

        each case problem of the Munich study)  \nConstruction of \ninadequate relations

        that stem from prior knowledge rather than the new theoretical \nconcepts
        that are to be learned.  \nNon-epistemic \nactivities \nDigressing off-topic.  \nOn
        the (2) microlevel, an individual argument consists of a claim, which can
        be grounded with a warrant \nand\/or specified by a qualifier (Toulmin, 1958;
        Toulmin, Rieke, \u0026 Janik, 1984). The warrant contains a \njustification
        for the claim based on grounds. The qualifier limits the validity of the statement
        and can be \nsometimes represented implicitly in the structure of an argument,
        e.g., indicated by \u201cperhaps\u201d. We regard the \nfrequent use of warrants
        and qualifiers in an argument as an indicator for high argumentative skill
        (see table 2).  \nOn the (3) macrolevel, argumentation sequences can be examined
        with respect to how learners connect \nsingle arguments and create an argumentation
        pattern together (Leit\u00e3o, 2000). The analysis typically focuses on \nthe
        rhetorical function of individual expressions in a sequence of contributions.
        Central concepts are argument, \ncounterargument and reply\/integration (see
        table 3).  \n \nTable 2: Categories of microlevel of formal dimension of argumentative

        \nAssessing the value of arguments or the group work. \n \nThe (4) social
        modes dimension (see table 4) indicates to what degree or in what ways learners
        refer to the \ncontributions of their learning partners. On this dimension,
        a number of social modes of co-construction and their relations to individual
        knowledge construction have been identified (Fischer et al., 2002). Learners
        may \nexplicate their knowledge, e.g., by contributing a new analysis of a
        problem case. Externalizations are discourse \nmoves that neither refer to
        preceding contributions of peers nor aim to elicit information from the learning
        \npartners. Learners may use the learning partner as resource and seek information
        (elicitation) in discourse from \nthe learning partners in order to solve
        a problem case. Learners need to build at least a minimum consensus \nregarding
        the learning task in a process of negotiation in order to improve collaboration
        (Clark \u0026 Brennan, \n1991). There are different styles of reaching consensus,
        however. Quick consensus building means that learners \naccept the contributions
        of their learning partners not in terms of taking over his or her perspective,
        but in order \nto be able to continue the discourse (Clark \u0026 Brennan,
        1991). Recent approaches towards collaborative learning \nstress that collaborative
        learners may eventually establish and maintain shared conceptions of a subject
        matter \n(integration-oriented consensus building). Learners approximate and
        integrate each other\u2019s perspective, \nsynthesize their ideas, and jointly
        try to make sense of a task (Nastasi \u0026 Clements, 1992). Conflict-oriented
        \nconsensus building has been considered an important component in the socio-cognitive
        perspective upon \ncollaborative learning (Doise \u0026 Mugny, 1984; Teasley,
        1997). By facing a critique, learners may be pushed to \ntest multiple perspectives
        or find more and better arguments for their positions (Chan, Burtis, \u0026
        Bereiter, 1997).  \nIn addition, any segment following an elicitation from
        another learning partner was coded on an explicit \ndichotomous (5) sub-dimension
        of reaction (no reaction vs. reaction). If a learner responded to an elicitation,
        \ne.g., by answering to a question, this response has been coded as reaction
        \n \nTable 4: Categories of social modes dimension of argumentative knowledge

        and applying the perspectives of the learning partners. \nConflict-oriented
        \nconsensus building \nDisagreeing, modifying or replacing the perspectives

        learners interact with the instructional design. The \ncomputer-supported
        collaboration script approach is often implemented with the help of prompts.
        These prompts \nsupport collaboration of learners and become part of the corpus
        data. This dimension considers how learners \nmake use of prompts. Learners
        could use the prompts in the intended manner, e.g., write a counterargument
        \nwhen they are asked to write a counterargument. But learners could also
        ignore the prompt, i.e., write nothing in \nresponse to the prompt. If learners
        are prompted to write a counterargument but wrote an argument, it would be
        \nan  unintended use of prompt. Obviously, this dimension could only be applied
        if prompts are part of the \ninstruction. Prompts within the corpus data will
        be only analyzed on this single dimension. \n \nTable 5: Categories of treatment

        quoted with \u0022\u003E\u0022 as in standard newsreaders and e-\nmail programs.
        Quoted text within the corpus data then will be only analyzed on this single
        dimension. \nExperimental Process \nWe used the Minorthird text-learning toolkit
        (Cohen et al, 2004), which contains a large collection of \nconfigurable machine
        learning algorithms that can be applied to text classification tasks, as a
        framework in \nwhich to conduct our research. Because Minorthird includes
        a wide range of text classification algorithms that \nall operate over text
        coded in the same format, it is a convenient test environment for experimentation.
        We used \nas a gold-standard corpus as set of 1255 separate text segments
        coded with the multi-dimensional coding scheme \ndescribed in the previous
        section. As described above, the coding scheme is composed of 7 dimensions,
        named \nepistemic, microlevel of argumentation, macrolevel of argumentation,
        social modes, reaction, treatment check, \nand quoted respectively. Each of
        these dimensions has a set of 2 or more categories associated with it. For
        example, macrolevel of argumentation has 7 (six theoretical and one \u201crest\u201d
        category) such categories, whereas \nmicrolevel of argumentation has 5 (four
        theoretical and one \u201crest\u201d category), and epistemic has 35 (thirty-four
        \ntheoretical and one \u201crest\u201d category). The \u201crest\u201d categories
        comprise prompts and quoted text. Every text \nsegment in the gold standard
        corpus is labeled with a category for each of the 7 dimensions. Our \nexperimentation
        followed a typical pattern for corpus based research, which we describe in
        this section. In other \nwords, we form hypotheses about what might work based
        on our understanding of the coding scheme and our \nexperience with the machine
        learning algorithms. We then run experiments with those algorithms and use
        the \nresults to deepen our understanding of the representation and the interaction
        between the machine learning \ntechniques and the data. We then revise our
        hypotheses and run additional experiments. We experimented with a \nrange
        of techniques in a semi-directed manner. It is this semi-directed experimentation
        process that we are \nworking towards automating in our continued research.
        We believe that if we could automate this process, we \nwill have found the
        final piece of the puzzle that is required to make this technology fully accessible
        to CSCL \nresearchers so that it could be applied to new problems without
        the aid of an experienced computational linguist. \nWe began our experimentation
        by testing a non-binary classifier called K-Nearest Neighbors to assign a
        \ncategory to each text for each of the seven dimensions. The difference between
        a binary classifier and a non-\nbinary classifier is that binary classifiers
        can only distinguish between two categories (i.e., positive examples \nversus
        negative examples), a non-binary classifier can in theory make any number
        of distinctions (e.g., the 35 \ntypes of epistemological categories). Since
        the majority of the 7 dimensions that are part of our coding scheme \ncontain
        more than two distinctions, a non-binary classifier was the most straightforward
        approach to use as a \nbaseline. We tested this approach using what is called
        a cross-validation evaluation methodology. What this \nmeans is that we divided
        our gold-standard corpus into 10 equal subsets of coded spans of text. For
        each of \nthese 10 subsets of data, we trained a model from the other nine
        subsets and tested on the selected subset so that \nwe were always testing
        on a different set of data than what we trained on. Each of these rounds of
        training and \ntesting are referred to as an iteration. So there are 10 iterations
        of training and testing for a 10-fold cross-\nvalidation evaluation such as
        this.  This process is important for obtaining an accurate measure of how
        well a \ntrained model will perform on additional data since it keeps a separation
        between data used for training the \nmodel and data used for testing the model.
        Once we had a measure of performance over each of the 10 subsets \nof data,
        we averaged those in order to obtain an estimate for the whole set. Cross-validation
        evaluations are \nstandard practice in machine learning research. We went
        through this process separately for each of the 7 \ndimensions. The results
        are presented in Table 5. The non-binary classifier only achieved an acceptable
        level of \nagreement with the gold standard in the case of reaction, achieving
        a Kappa of .81. \n \nTable 5: Performance of Non-binary classifier over data
        \nName of Dimension  Number of Categories  Kappa \nepistemic 35  .51 \nmicrolevel
        of argumentation  4  .54 \nmacrolevel of argumentation  7  .54 \nSocial modes  21  .35
        \nreaction 3  .81 \nTreatment check  4  0 \nQuoted   2  .63 \n \nTo assess
        the learnability of each of the categories along the 7 dimensions, we then
        began to experiment with \nbinary classifiers. There is a much wider range
        of non-binary classifiers to choose from. For each category along \neach dimension
        we computed a Kappa value for a wide range of binary classifiers, each of
        which was given the \ntask if distinguishing example texts that are assigned
        the corresponding category along its associated dimension \nand those that
        are not. We noticed that some categories were much easier to predict than
        others. Normally, it \nwas the categories for which there were more than 25
        examples in the corpus. Thus, we hypothesized that an \napproach where we
        cascaded the binary classifiers so that we first applied the most accurate
        classifiers and then \nthe less accurate classifiers only if the accurate
        ones did not predict a positive match would be more accurate. \nAgain we adopted
        a cross-validation methodology. This time it was necessary to select on each
        iteration of \nthe 10-fold cross-validation evaluation, not only a testing
        set, but also a validation set on which to determine the \nrank ordering of
        the individual binary classifiers. This is so that the set used for rank ordering
        the binary \nclassifiers is not either the same set that they were trained
        over, nor the same set they will be tested over. This \nensures both optimal
        training and most accurate testing. Thus, on each iteration, we trained a
        separate binary \nclassifier for each category associated with each dimension
        over 8 subsets of data. We then tested the accuracy \nof these classifiers
        on the validation set. For each dimension, we rank ordered the binary classifiers
        according to \ntheir accuracy over the validation set. We then applied them
        in rank order over the test set, selecting as an \nassigned code the first
        binary classifier that indicated a positive match for an example text. We
        computed the \naccuracy of the cascaded classifier over each of the 10 test
        sets using this approach and then averaged the results as in the first experiment
        with non-binary classifiers. The assumption here is that if one classifier
        gives a higher \nKappa value over the validation set, then it will most likely
        be more reliable in terms of predicting correct labels \nover the testing
        set, hence it is more probable that its prediction is correct instead of the
        classifier with a lower \nKappa. The best results we obtained were with the
        Voted Perceptron Learning algorithm, which gives better \nresults with our
        data in general than the other classification techniques such as DecisionTrees,
        NaiveBayes \napproach, SVM Learning, etc. In the next section we present our
        current best results. \nOUTCOMES \nSince the results for the reaction dimension
        were already acceptable with non-binary classification, we restricted \nour
        experimentation to the remaining 6 dimensions. In all cases we achieved a
        significant increase over the non-\nbinary classification result except in
        the case of the epistemic dimension.  We first present the Kappa we achieve
        \nover the whole corpus using the cascaded approach. We then present the Kappa
        we achieve if we use a more \nconservative approach, only assigning a category
        to the portion of the corpus where our performance over the \nvalidation set
        was highest. The task was accomplished by eliminating the least accurate binary
        classifiers from \nthe cascaded model one by one until an acceptable Kappa
        was achieved. In that column we present the best \nKappa we were able to achieve
        and the percentage of the corpus it was computed over. For example, for the
        \nmacrolevel of argumentation we are able to achieve a Kappa of .83 over 92%
        of the corpus, leaving 8% of the \ncorpus uncoded.  In the case where this
        conservative classifier is used, a human coder only needs to code 8% of \nthe
        corpus by hand since the accuracy over the automatically coded portion of
        the corpus is acceptable. \nTable 7: The table compares the accuracy computed
        in terms of Cohen\u2019s Kappa between the gold standard \ncodes and 3 approaches

        corpus) \nQuoted  .63   .98  .98 (100% of corpus) \n \nAlthough the knowledge
        that is brought to bear on the coding process for the 7 different dimensions
        has \ndifferent requirements (for example, in terms of how much context is
        required or what the distinctions mean \nabout the student\u2019s contribution),
        in all cases except the epistemic dimension the same procedure lead to a \nclassifier
        that achieved a significantly higher level of agreement with the gold standard
        than the non-binary \nclassifier.  Thus, this evaluation demonstrates that
        the cascaded binary classifier has some generality. \nWe plan to continue
        experimenting with alternative classification approaches for the social modes
        and \nepistemic dimensions. Similar to our previous explorations where we
        clustered examples according to similarity \nof coding across the 7 dimensions
        of our coding scheme, we are now exploring the possibility of clustering the
        \ncoded text segments according to similarity of vocabulary distributions
        within text segments.  We predict that \nwithin clusters of similar texts,
        there will be a smaller number of categories for each dimension than over
        the \nwhole set. Thus, we predict that training a classifier over just the
        examples within clusters will be more accurate. \nDISCUSSION \nWe have presented
        and evaluated technology for streamlining the process of multi-dimensional
        analysis of \nthe collaborative learning data. We have argued that such technology
        could potentially have a tremendous \nimpact on this increasingly important
        part of CSCL research. Beyond this community a wide range of other \nbehavioral
        researchers including social scientists, psychologists, and other learning
        scientists and education \nresearchers collect, code, and analyze large quantities
        of natural language corpus data as an important part of \ntheir research.  \nOne
        important outcome from this research is that even sophisticated coding schemes
        such as the 7 \ndimensional coding scheme discussed here that requires several
        weeks of intensive training for a human to apply \nreliably can be largely
        automated. 4 of the 7 dimensions (i.e., macrolevel of argumentation, reaction,
        treatment \ncheck, and quoted) can be applied fully automatically with an
        acceptable level of accuracy, as measured using a cross validation methodology
        over our gold standard coded corpus. Significant portions of the additional
        two \ndimensions (microlevel of argumentation and social modes) can be applied
        fully automatically to a significant \nportion of the data, thus cutting down
        the number of examples that must be coded by a human (an 88% \nreduction in
        the case of microlevel of argumentation dimension and a 25% reduction in the
        case of social modes \ndimension). While the results with epistemic dimension
        were lower, and the Kappa value over the whole set of \ndata was only .51,
        the percent agreement was 80% over the portion of the corpus that received
        a committed \ncode. This is 30% higher than the break even point for time
        savings with checking and correcting automatically \ncoded examples according
        to Ros\u00e9 and colleagues (submitted). Thus, even with this level of accuracy,
        the \nautomatic category predictions can lead to a significant reduction in
        coding time on the epistemic dimension. \nAnother important outcome from this
        research is that the cascaded binary classification approach, which we \nexplore,
        has some generality across multiple dimensions of our coding scheme although
        they are quite different \nin terms of the types and numbers of distinctions
        that must be made. Thus, it is an approach that is likely to be \nreused successfully
        with other coding schemes and eventually be part of an eventual approach to
        automatic \nselection and tuning of machine learning approaches to applying
        categorical coding schemes. \nBeyond improvements to the data analysis that
        is central to our process, automatic coding technology would \nalso enable
        new kinds of instructional interventions. For example, automatic on-line analysis
        of chat interactions \ncould provide instructors with the capability to monitor
        the progress of multiple interactions occurring in \nparallel, indicating
        where the instructor\u2019s intervention is most needed, and even what the
        specific needs are that \nshould be addressed. Further ahead, a fully automatic
        system could also enable automatic adaptive interventions \nfor collaborative
        learning. Those interventions would be more flexible\/adaptive than current
        static interventions. \nFor example, a collaboration script for argument construction
        could be strategically applied when learners do \nnot ground and warrant their
        claims and it could be faded out carefully when learners develop internal
        cognitive \nscripts that guide their argumentative knowledge construction.
        Such a system could prevent effects like over-\nscripting (Dillenbourg, 2004)
        or negative interaction effects between scripts (Kollar \u0026 Fischer, 2004).

        PROBLEM BACKGROUND\u003C\/dc:subject\u003E\u003Cdc:description\u003E\n          Abstract.
        Process analyses are becoming more and more standard in research on computer-supported
        collaborative learning. This paper presents the rational as well as results
        of an evaluation of a tool called TagHelper, designed for streamlining the
        process of multi-dimensional analysis of the collaborative learning process.
        In comparison with a hand-coded corpus coded with a 7 dimensional coding scheme,
        TagHelper is able to achieve an acceptable level of agreement (Cohen\u0026apos;s
        Kappa of.7 or more) along 6 out of 7 of the dimensions when we commit only
        to the portion of the corpus where the predictor has the highest certainty.
        In 5 of those cases, the percentage of the corpus where the predictor is confident
        enough to commit a code is at least 88 % of the corpus. Consequences for theory-building
        with respect to automatic corpus analysis are formulated. Potential applications
        as a support tool for process analyses, as real-time support for facilitators
        of on-line discussions, and for the development of more adaptive instructional
        support for computer-supported collaboration are discussed.\u003C\/dc:description\u003E\u003Cdc:contributor\u003E\n          The
