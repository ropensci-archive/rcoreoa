CORE API R client

CORE API docs: https://core.ac.uk/docs/

Get an API key at https://core.ac.uk/api-keys/register. You'll need one, 
so do this now if you haven't yet. Once you have the key, you can pass it 
into the `key` parameter, or as a much better option store your key as an 
environment variable with the name `CORE_KEY` or an R option as `core_key`. 
See `?Startup` for how to work with env vars and R options

## About CORE

CORE's tagline is: "Aggregating the world's open access research papers"

CORE offers seamless access to millions of open access research papers, enrich
the collected data for text-mining and provide unique services to the research
community.

For more infos on CORE, see https://core.ac.uk/about

## Install

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rcoreoa")
```

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/rcoreoa")
```

```{r}
library("rcoreoa")
```

## Pagination

Note that you are limited to a maximum of 100 results for the search functions;
use combination of `page` and `limit` parameters to paginate through results. 
For example:

```{r}
x1 <- core_search(query = 'ecology', limit = 100, page = 1)
x2 <- core_search(query = 'ecology', limit = 100, page = 2)
head(x1$data[,1:3])
head(x2$data[,1:3])
```

## high- vs. low-level interfaces

Each function has a higher level interface that does HTTP request for data and parses
the JSON using `jsonlite`. This is meant for those who want everything done for them,
but there's a time penalty for as the parsing adds extra time. If you just want raw JSON
unparsed text, you can use the low level interface.

The low level version of each function has `_` at the end (e.g., `core_search_`), while the
high level version doesn't have the `_` (e.g., `core_search`).

The high level version of each function uses the low level method, and the low level method
does all the logic and HTTP requesting, whereas the high level simply parses the output.

## Search

```{r}
res <- core_search(query = 'ecology', limit = 12)
tibble::as_tibble(res$data)
```

## Advanced Search

```{r}
query <- data.frame("all_of_the_words" = "data mining",
                    "without_the_words" = "social science",
                    "year_from" = "2013",
                    "year_to" = "2014")

res <- core_advanced_search(query)
tibble::as_tibble(res$data)
```

# Articles

```{r output.lines = 1:10}
core_articles(id = 21132995)
```

# Article history

```{r output.lines = 1:7}
core_articles_history(id = '21132995')
```

# Journals

```{r eval = FALSE}
core_journals(id = '2220-721X')
```

# Get PDFs

The `_` for these methods means that you get a file path back to the PDF, while the
high level version without the `_` parses the pdf to text for you.

```{r eval=FALSE}
core_articles_pdf_(11549557)
```
